    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>In march i finished my last School Project, ft_transcendence</p>
    <p>The next project was applying [currently still is]. Big Questions i had [still have]: where to apply and what do i wanna do? Because of this i probably took a lil bit to much time figuring out things and made this website while at it.</p>
    <p>Also, i picked up some old projects, like playing the piano and starting to learn spanish again.</p>

    <h2>2023</h2>
    <p>This was a very interesting and full year when it comes events, appointments and life</p>
    <p>The year started like no other. With an new diseas on my shoulder, a lot of change in the friend circle and some 42 stress, it would sound like something nobody wants to do again. </p>
    <p>But this year was still amazing. It was just this and that and all. So much stuff happened, so many new things i discoverd. </p>
    <p>Be it moving out from my parents house, playing tunes for parties, still being good at video games :P, or visiting all kind of places through hackathons and getting insight on how hard CTF challenges can be.</p>
    <p>All in all i give this year a solid Green in a scale of crow to 11</p>
