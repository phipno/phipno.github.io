    <h1>My Journey Through the Stars</h1>
    <p class="note">My English writing skills definitely need some work, so enjoy this blog!</p>

      <h2>2024</h2>
      <p>In March, I finished my last 42 coding project, ft_transcendence.</p>
      <p>The next project was applying for jobs (currently still is). Big questions I had (and still have): Where to apply
        and what do I want to do? Because of this, I probably took a little too much time figuring things out and made
        this website while I was at it.</p>
      <p>Also, I picked up some old projects, like playing the piano and starting to learn Spanish again.</p>

      <h2>2023</h2>
      <p>This was a very interesting and eventful year.</p>
      <p>The year started like no other. With a new disease on my shoulder, a lot of changes in my friend circle, and some
        42 stress, it sounds like something nobody would want to go through again.</p>
      <p>But this year was still amazing. It was just one thing after another. So much happened, and I discovered so many
        new things.</p>
      <p>From moving out of my parents' house, playing tunes for parties, still being good at video games :P, to visiting
        all kinds of places through hackathons and getting insight into how hard CTF challenges can be.</p>
      <p>All in all, I give this year a solid Green on a scale from crow to 11.</p>

      <p>“Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” — George Bernard Shaw.</p>
      <p>“Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.” — Stephen Hawking.</p>
      <p>Some random quotes about change so I sound wiser than I really am. Still, this year brought a lot of change into
        my small little cosmos.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It started with quitting my job as a surveyor at a regional council.</li>
        <li>Doing the piscine (entrance exam) for 42Heilbronn.</li>
        <li>Getting accepted and now studying at 42Heilbronn.</li>
        <li>Getting diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</li>
        <li>And just some other regular struggles everyone my age has.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2021</h2>
      <p>El <i>español</i> es bonito.</p>
      <p>That's what everyone thinks when they want to learn a new language, I guess.</p>
      <p>Either way, my apprenticeship as a surveyor was finished. Graduated and left with a <i>Fachhochschulreife</i>
        (some German certificate that lets me study at universities, kinda).</p>
      <p>I did my best in the topic of GeoData and found a lot of fun in it. I also wondered if I should have done an
        apprenticeship as a geomaticist.</p>
      <p>Working in the Flurneuordnungsamt was a really interesting time that I won't forget. I met a lot of different
        characters, saw many projects with a lot of people involved, and learned about so many specific technologies and
        software. All in all, it was a crazy time there.</p>

      <h2>2020</h2>
      <p>Do I even remember this (it's been 4 years now)? Time passes without you even acknowledging it.</p>
      <p>Just crazy when you come to think about it.</p>
      <p>In our way-too-fast world, with time pinned in your face, looking back feels like a hypnotic, distant dream.</p>
      <p>Am I the only one who feels like this, or does everyone acknowledge the passage of time?</p>
      <p>Coming back to my work life, yeah, the second and third years of my apprenticeship were probably my favorite
        years. You finally understand things and can do them on your own. You get some responsibilities, yay!</p>
